The process involves performing feature extraction using different pre-trained models such as Inception-V3, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16. The goal is to extract features from various layers of these models, specifically from layers with different dimensions like 128, 256, 512, and 1024.

To extract features, you can follow these steps:

Load the pre-trained model: Import the pre-trained model you want to use, such as Inception-V3, ResNet50, VGG19, or VGG16, using a deep learning library like TensorFlow or Keras.

Remove the last classification layer: Remove the fully connected or classification layer from the loaded model. This layer is typically responsible for predicting specific classes and is not needed for feature extraction.

Extract features from desired layers: Specify the layers from which you want to extract features. You can choose layers with different dimensions, such as 128, 256, 512, or 1024, depending on your requirements.

Pass the input data through the model: Provide your input data to the pre-trained model and propagate it through the network to obtain the feature representations.

Retrieve the feature vectors: Extract the feature vectors from the desired layers of the model. These feature vectors represent the learned features from the input data.

By following these steps, you can extract features from various layers of pre-trained models like Inception-V3, ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16, with different dimensions of 128, 256, 512, and 1024.
